Assholes who own the world and how they came about stealing it.

America is lucky.  We had Washington when it mattered, we had Lincoln when it mattered. And we had FDR when it mattered.  But, unfortunately, a bastard named Dulles killed JFK when it mattered most.  Then Nixon, Bush, Bush again, Coolidge, Hoover (big business ONLY), then Reagan.  Why we are still a republic is beyond me.  I would argue we are no longer a democratic-republic. We are an oligarchy ran by the fucking MIC.
Every president since Washington has bailed out the fucking rich.  But only the democratic ones bailed out Americans. At least, most of them.  Clinton was an exception.  And Obama to a degree.  So why, you ask?  Because power is abused when absolute.  And the Military Industrial Complex has absolute power.  They're 'future weapons of war' are far beyond any and everyone else.

Their biggest crime by far is zero-point energy and what they did are are doing with that unlimited power.
